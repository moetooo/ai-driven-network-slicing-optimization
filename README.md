# ai-driven-network-slicing-optimization
This project leverages AI for optimizing resource allocation in network slicing. By using a deep learning model, it predicts optimal bandwidth, CPU, and memory distribution based on parameters like traffic load, latency, jitter, and slice type. The model helps improve network efficiency and performance by dynamically adjusting resource allocation.
