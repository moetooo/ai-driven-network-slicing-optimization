# AI-Driven Network Slicing Optimization

## Overview
This project utilizes AI to optimize resource allocation in network slicing. The deep learning model predicts the optimal distribution of resources such as bandwidth, CPU, and memory, based on input network parameters like traffic volume, latency, jitter, and slice type. The goal is to improve network performance through dynamic resource allocation.

## Key Features
- **Predictive Model**: A deep learning model that predicts optimal resource allocation (bandwidth, CPU, memory) for network slicing based on features such as traffic volume, packet arrival rate, latency, jitter, etc.
- **AI-Driven Optimization**: Implements neural networks using TensorFlow/Keras for accurate predictions.
- **Scalable & Flexible**: Can be applied to various network configurations and conditions.
- **Network Slicing Efficiency**: Aims to improve network slicing and resource management.
